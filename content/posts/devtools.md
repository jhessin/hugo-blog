# [ Progressive Web Apps ](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)

This is my goal for my REV app. I want to create a PWA that allows full use of
the app while offline. This seems to be tricky because the REV is MASSIVE.

# [ Vercel ](https://vercel.com) API's

Vercel is the website that NextJs uses to host it's sites. Of course it
supports NextJs but also MANY others.

## [ Create React App ](https://reactjs.org/)

This is the bare bones react app. No access to the backend and not much in the
way of storage PWA's.

## [ NextJs ](https://nextjs.org)

This is a very simple platform that uses react but provides access to routes
for API calls. It uses a `pages` "magic folder" that automatically creates a
url path for each file/folder inside of it. If a react component is the default
export then it becomes a page, if it exports an express like function it
becomes an api call. It also uses magic filenames to generate multiple pages
for a single file.

## [ GatsbyJs ](https://gatsbyjs.com)

This is similar to NextJs with the magic `pages` folder. It doesn't use api
calls however instead it seems to generate a [ GraphQL ](https://graphql.org) database at compile time.
This can't be updated during runtime however which is very limiting.

## [ Hexo ](https://hexo.io)

Hexo is a static site generator primarily for blogs. It generates html from
markdown.

## [ Eleventy ](https://11ty.dev)

Another static site generator that generates html from markdown. Specifically
an alternative to Jekyll.

## [ Hugo ](https://gohugo.io)

Hugo is written in go and serves markdown files. There are no npm packages
involved and it is more for blogging, etc.
